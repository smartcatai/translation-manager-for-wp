Smartcat Translation Manager offers the easiest way to translate your Wordpress pages and posts into any language in a few clicks.

== Description ==

We’ve developed this plugin for those who create great content and want to share it with the whole world. Smartcat Translation Manager helps you connect with a global audience by effortlessly translating pages and posts into other languages.

== How it works ==

1. Select one or several posts.
2. Send them to the translation service by clicking the “Send to translation” button or choosing the appropriate bulk action.
3. Once the translation is completed, a new draft will appear containing the translated text.

== Installation ==

Please note! For this plugin to work, you need to install the Polylang plugin first.

1. Install the Smartcat Translation Manager plugin manually with an FTP client by navigating to '/wp-content/plugins/translation-connectors/', or automatically through the upload feature in the WordPress dashboard.
2. Install and then activate [Polylang plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/polylang/) on the “Plugins” page.
3. Activate the Smartcat Translation Manager plugin.
4. Sign up to [Smartcat](https://www.smartcat.ai), go to the [API page](https://smartcat.ai/ApiAccess/Credentials) and generate an API key.
5. Back in Wordpress, go to the plugin’s settings page (Settings→Smartcat Translation Manager) and enter your API credentials.

You’re all set! The world is waiting for your content, so go ahead and translate it in a simple and quick way.
