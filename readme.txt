Smartcat Translation Manager offers the easiest way to translate your WordPress pages and posts into any language in a few clicks.

== Description ==

[Smartcat](https://www.smartcat.ai/?utm_source=connectors&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wordpress) connects linguists, companies, and agencies to streamline the translation of any content into any language, on demand. Our platform puts your translation process on autopilot, from content creation to payments.

The extension works by linking your WordPress website to a Smartcat account and pushing the content for translation upon request. After the translation is done in Smartcat — either by yourself, your own volunteers, or hired vendors — it is automatically pulled back to WordPress.
